<h2 id="aboutTitle">About</h2>

<p id="about-p">I am a former teacher and avid baker. I have also been into art since high school and have decided to combine my love of baking with art. I started baking for friends and family and created Austin Dream Cakes a few years later. I have always enjoyed teaching and missed having a classroom. In 2015, I decided to share my love of cake decorating with children in my neighborhood and started cake decorating camps in the summer. I also started offering classes during the holidays. A year later, I started offering classes to adults. I love what I do and enjoy making people happy with my creations!</p>
